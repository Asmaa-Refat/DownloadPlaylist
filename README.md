This program is a really useful one implemented with **Python** 
- it is basically a program that takes a Youtube Playlist link and download all the videos inside of it. not to mention that the playlist has to be public.
- there are two files one without GUI [you run it from the terminal] and one with GUI.
  Enjoy ☺️
